				<h3>2022 BMW 330i</h3>
				<img src="img/2020 BMW 330i.jpg" alt="2022 BMW 330i">
				<p>$25,000</p>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>No matter which one of its silky powertrains is on duty, the 2022 BMW 3-series is supremely satisfying to drive. While its remarkable refinement is offset by not-quite-great steering feel, its body is composed on any kind of road, its brakes are strong, and its ride is comfortable for daily chores. Plus, its interior is rich and roomy and it has a sizable trunk. Rivals such as the Genesis G70 offer better value, and the Alfa Romeo Giulia is a sexier alternative, but no other sports sedan possesses the bandwidth of the Bimmer. Along with a sublime eight-speed automatic and rear- or all-wheel drive, the 3-series is available with a terrific turbocharged four-cylinder (330i), a plug-in-hybrid setup (330e) with up to 23 miles of all-electric range, or a ferocious 382-hp turbo straight-six (M340i) that's as eager and effortless as engines come. Thankfully, the sedan's excellence doesn't begin and end with driving excitement.</p>

				<h4>2024 Ram 1500 TRX</h4>
				<img src="img/2024 ram 1500 trx final edition.jpeg" alt="2024 RAM 1500 TRX">
				<p>$98,335</p>
				<h5>Overview</h5>
				<p>A beast-like snarl snorts beyond the crest of a muddy ORV trail, but this is no ordinary wild animal or hog, it's the furiously quick 702-hp Ram 1500 TRX. Under the hood, a powerful supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 sucks up fuel as if it were drinking from a garden hose. An eight-speed automatic transmission handles gear shifts and the truck's four-wheel drive system carries this enormous off-road animal in even the most treacherous places. The TRX only has two predators to look out for: the 700-hp Ford F-150 Raptor R and the quickest truck we've ever tested, the all-electric Rivian R1T. Unfortunately, time has run out for the mighty TRX, as Ram announced 2024 as its final year. But that didn't stop us from including it on our 2024 10Best Trucks and SUVs and 2024 Editors' Choice lists. Although this year marks the end of the TRX, a twin-turbo V-6-powered replacement, dubbed the RHO, will eventually launch as a 2025 model-year pickup.</p>

				<h6>2024 BMW X3</h6>
				<img src="img/2024 bmw x3.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$47,895</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>Are compact luxury crossovers the new sports sedans? Judging by the way the 2024 BMW X3 handles corners we're tempted to answer affirmatively. Based on the venerable 3-series four-door, the X3 blends the same refined nature and engaging handling with a practical body style capable of hauling more cargo—a blend of traits that have landed it on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. Entry-level models come with a 248-hp turbocharged four-cylinder but the sportier M40i gets a 382-hp turbo inline-six. Both provide effortless power, but the inline-six delights with its smooth-running nature and added muscle. The X3's design is just premium enough to be recognized as a luxury SUV without resorting to garish adornments. Its interior is well-matched to its exterior styling, with an orderly look and smartly integrated technology. Those seeking more designer duds may find rivals such as the Genesis GV70 or the Volvo XC60 more to their liking. But the X3's focus on driving verve is something we can get behind, even with its more sober appearance.</p>

				<h6>2024 Mercedes GLC class plug-in-hybrid</h6>
				<img src="img/2023 mercedes benz glc class plug-in-hybrid.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$48,600</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>While it shares its underpinnings with the C-class sedan, the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC-class SUV serves a slightly different type of driver. The GLC300 is still fairly athletic, but if you're someone who values maximum driving fun, the C-class—or one of the AMG-tuned GLCs (reviewed separately)—is a better choice. What the GLC does best is cradle its occupants in a cabin outfitted with luxury features and plenty of tech, including an infotainment system with an 11.9-inch screen that rises upward from the center console in easy reach of the driver's right hand. All GLC300s are powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 255 horsepower; a nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive are standard, but all-wheel drive is available as an option. The cargo bay behind the rear seats is more voluminous than what you'll get in the C-class, but the same could be said of many of the GLC's rivals, including the BMW X3, the Jaguar F-Pace, and the Volvo XC60. </p>

				<h6>2021 Ford Mustang mach 1 </h6>
				<img src="img/2021 ford mustang mach 1.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$29,145</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>For more than 55 years, the Ford Mustang has continued to evolve into a more sophisticated steed. This iteration comes standard with a 310-hp turbocharged inline-four EcoBoost engine with a six-speed manual transmission. And while the pony car gets as wild as the 760-hp Shelby GT500, reviewed separately, the more conventional choice is the Mustang GT with the 450-hp V-8 engine. Both the four-cylinder and V-8 can be mated to a manual transmission or a 10-speed automatic. Mustangs are offered either as a hard-shell coupe or rag-top convertible, but every Mustang powers the rear wheels. Although a High Performance 330-hp EcoBoost is an available upgrade for the four-cylinder, the Mustang is best served with the growling V-8. While its closest muscular rival, the Chevy Camaro, has a more ergonomic interior, the Mustang's larger back seat and better outward visibility make it easier to live with.</p>

				<h6>2023 Mercedes AMG C63</h6>
				<img src="img/2023 mercedes amg c63.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$83,000</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>Life is short: Skip the SUV and drive a real performance car. Might we suggest the absolutely ballistic 2023 Mercedes-Benz C63 S? This twin-turbo two-door boasts a 503-hp V-8 powertrain and a chassis that delivers laser-focused handling, making it one of the most brutish models in Mercedes-AMG’s product portfolio. It doesn’t ride like a luxury car though it offers plenty of high-end features and premium materials inside its well-equipped cabin. It should be noted that the C63 offered this year rides on the previous-generation C-class platform, so those seeking the latest and greatest should consider waiting for next year’s 2024 model, which will be offered only as a sedan and will be powered by an even-more-ballistic 671-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid powertrain.</p>

				<h6>2022 Toyota GR86</h6>
				<img src="img/2022 toyota gr86.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$29,495</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>If we gave out an award for Most Improved Sports Car, the Toyota GR86 would very possibly be the big winner. This eminently entertaining rear-wheel-drive coupe's second generation arrived in 2022 and addressed our big issue with the original model: a weak engine. The second time around, power comes from a 228-hp flat-four with plenty of mid-range power, and although a six-speed manual comes standard (and is the only way to go), a six-speed automatic is available. You won't hear us telling you to opt for it. The GR86 is small and affordable, like, say, a Mazda MX-5 Miata, only with a tiny Porsche 911–type rear seat that enables you to take small fry along. Its trunk also affords reasonable cargo space, which the Miata doesn't offer, either. The GR86's mechanical twin, the Subaru BRZ, offers a virtually identical experience, so choosing between them ultimately comes down to which badge you prefer. As a 2+2 coupe built mainly for playtime, the GR86 does suffer from road noise, particularly on the highway, and the music produced by the boxer engine isn't exactly worth buying tickets to hear live. Still, plenty of cornering grip, great balance, sharp steering, and a rev-happy engine make the GR86 fun to drive, no matter where you're going. It's everything an entry-level sports car should be.</p>

				<h6>2022 Porsche 911 GT3</h6>
				<img src="img/2022 porsche 911 gt3.jpg" alt="2020 Truck">
				<p>$162,450</p>
				<h7>Overview</h7>
				<p>With an exclusive naturally aspirated engine and race car-inspired components, the 2022 Porsche 911 GT3 is optimized for driver engagement and track-day glory. Porsche enhances its most visceral 911 variant with a control-arm front suspension—the first on a 911 road car—and an unusual rear wing that's mounted at the top instead of the bottom. The GT3 is also the only 911 that's not turbocharged, and the responsive nature and immersive sounds of its 502-hp 4.0-liter flat-six qualify as inspirational. The specialness of the rear-mounted mill is further realized by the telepathic seven-speed PDK automatic transmission or the rewarding six-speed manual. Thanks to a unique suspension setup and track-focused tire options, the 2022 911 GT3 has a surprisingly supple, albeit firm, ride and incredible steering feel that are just a few of the reasons it's so exhilarating to drive.</p>
